# 4.Multi-Pass-Shader
This project shows simple ways to do multi-pass shader with very basic operations.
Two ways demostrated here:
1. One shader contains two passes (meaning contains two `pass{}` blocks) - will work on getting the result from previous pass in a future project.
2. Apply two materials with a shader on each of them on a game object.

Results and details as shown below:
1. 1 shader 2 passes
